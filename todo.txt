Refactoring/bugs:
 - Do refactoring for render! It's a mess!
 - Check the Array2d (for cols/rows).
 - Do "mines around" optimization (include mines_around in Cell struct).
 - Do refactoring for vs_commands.
 - Move vs_* file to separate lib?

Features:
 - Do table of records (best scores)?
 - Do loading skin (colors etc) from file?
 - Do an UI (buttons, timers etc on window)?
